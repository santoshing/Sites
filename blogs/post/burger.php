                     Preheat oven to 425Â°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Arrange
                     4 (1/4-cup) mounds of cheese on prepared pan spaced 3 inches apart and 11/2 inches
                     from edges. Flatten each mound into a 3-inch circle. Bake in preheated oven just
                     until edges of cheese rounds look dry and lacy, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from oven.
                     Working quickly, place 2 split buns, cut sides down, on top of cheese rounds, and
                     press down. Let stand, undisturbed, 5 minutes. Slide parchment with buns off baking
                     sheet, and let buns stand on parchment, undisturbed, until ready to serve. Line
                     baking sheet with fresh parchment; repeat with remaining cheese and buns.
