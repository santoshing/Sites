                     Pastas are divided into two broad categories: dried (pasta secca) and fresh (pasta
                     fresca). Most dried pasta is produced commercially via an extrusion process, although
                     it can be produced at home. Fresh pasta is traditionally produced by hand, sometimes
                     with the aid of simple machines.[3] Fresh pastas available in grocery stores are
                     produced commercially by large-scale machines.

                     Both dried and fresh pastas come in a number of shapes and varieties, with 310
                     specific forms known by over 1,300 documented names.[4] In Italy, the names of
                     specific pasta shapes or types often vary by locale. For example, the pasta form
                     cavatelli is known by 28 different names depending upon the town and region. Common
                     forms of pasta include long and short shapes, tubes, flat shapes or sheets, miniature
                     shapes for soup, those meant to be filled or stuffed, and specialty or decorative
                     shapes.[5]
