                     Pizza (/ˈpiːtsə/ PEET-sə, Italian: [ˈpittsa]; Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of
                     Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough
                     topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies,
                     mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high
                     temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1]

                     The term pizza was first recorded in the year 997, in a Latin manuscript from the
                     southern Italian town of Gaeta, in Lazio, on the border with Campania.[2] Raffaele
                     Esposito is often credited for creating modern pizza in Naples.[3][4][5][6] In 2009,
                     Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a traditional speciality
                     guaranteed dish. In 2017, the art of making Neapolitan pizza was added to UNESCO's
                     list of intangible cultural heritage.[7]

                     Pizza and its variants are among the most popular foods in the world. Pizza is sold
                     at a variety of restaurants, including pizzerias (pizza specialty restaurants),
                     Mediterranean restaurants, via delivery, and as street food.[8] In Italy, pizza
                     served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife
                     and fork.[9][10] In casual settings, however, it is typically cut into slices to be
                     eaten while held in the hand. Pizza is also sold in grocery stores in a variety of
                     forms, including frozen or as kits for self-assembly. They are then cooked using a
                     home oven.

                     In 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion, and in the US it was $44 billion
                     spread over 76,000 pizzerias.[11] Overall, 13% of the U.S. population aged two years
                     and over consumed pizza on any given day.[12]
