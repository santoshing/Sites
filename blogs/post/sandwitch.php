                     A sandwich is a food typically consisting of vegetables, sliced cheese or meat,
                     placed on or between slices of bread, or more generally any dish wherein bread serves
                     as a container or wrapper for another food type.[1][2][3] The sandwich began as a
                     portable, convenient finger food in the Western world, though over time it has become
                     prevalent worldwide.

                     In the 21st century there has been considerable debate over the precise definition of
                     sandwich, and specifically whether a hot dog or open sandwich can be categorized as
                     such. In the United States, the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug
                     Administration are the responsible agencies. The USDA uses the definition, "at least
                     35% cooked meat and no more than 50% bread" for closed sandwiches, and "at least 50%
                     cooked meat" for open sandwiches.[4] In Britain, the British Sandwich Association
                     defines a sandwich as "any form of bread with a filling, generally assembled cold", a
                     definition which includes wraps and bagels, but excludes dishes assembled and served
                     hot, such as burgers.[5]
